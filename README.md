# tensorFlowTraining
This repo was designed to be a platform to document some of my learning of machine learning (ML) and the tensorflow API. I have already studied some books I bought from humble bundle about ML and based off that wrote very rudimentary ML models. 
The figure below is my linear regression code at work, it randomly generates data points and the model has to choose the best linear expression to describe the relationship between the scalar independant values and their respective dependant values in the range (explanatory variable).

Not only that I made a pretty simple Neural Network with 200ish neurons that predicted the MNIST hand writing database of written numbers.

<p> One thing that should be noted is that for both the linaer and logistic regression scripts, I generate random date based off of distribution. So the linear and logistic trends being detected are not of any coherent sense. This was intentional as I manily wanted to play around with the API rather than apply it just yet.</p>
